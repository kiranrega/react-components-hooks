Build a tabs component that displays one panel of content at a time depending on the active tab element. Some HTML is provided for you as example contents.

Requirements:

- Clicking on a tab makes it the active tab. Add a visual indication (e.g. using blue text color) for the active tab to differentiate it from the non-active tabs.
- At all times, only one panel's contents should be displayed â€” the one corresponding to the active tab's.

The ARIA Authoring Practices Guide has a long list of guidelines https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tabpanel/ 
for the ARIA roles, states, and properties to add to the various elements of a tabs component. We should implement the 
following guidelines for this question:

- The element that serves as the container for the set of tabs has role `tablist`.
- Each element that serves as a tab has role `tab` and is contained within the element with role `tablist`.
- Each element that contains the content panel for a tab has role `tabpanel`.
- Each element with role `tab` has the property `aria-controls` referring to its associated tabpanel element.
- The active tab element has the state `aria-selected` set to `true` and all other tab elements have it set to `false`.
- Each element with role `tabpanel` has the property `aria-labelledby` referring to its associated tab element.

It is also important that we use a <button> element to build the tabs as they need to be focusable and interactive.
